# AetherEngine

**AetherEngine** is a lightweight, modular game engine designed for flexible game development.  
The name *Aether* refers to the classical concept of the upper sky or pure air, symbolizing the engine's focus on high performance, openness, and limitless creative possibilities.

cd AetherEngine
```

2. **Build with CMake**

```bash
cmake --list-presets
cmake --preset <preset-name>       # configure using a preset
cmake --build --preset <preset-name>  # build using the same preset
```

3. **Run tests**

# FIXME: update with actual test command
ctest
```

## Aether - The Concept

In ancient philosophy, _Aether_ was considered the pure upper air that the gods breathed, distinct from the normal air we breathe on Earth.
In the context of AetherEngine, it represents:

- **Purity**: clean, efficient, and lightweight code
- **Freedom**: modular design allowing limitless creative possibilities
- **Performance**: targeting high-performance real-time rendering
